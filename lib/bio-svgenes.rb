# Please require your code below, respecting the bioruby directory tree. 
# For instance, perhaps the only uncommented line in this file might 
# be something like this:
#
#   require 'bio/sequence/awesome_sequence_plugin_thingy'
#
# and then create the ruby file 'lib/bio/sequence/awesome_sequence_thingy.rb'
# and put your plugin's code there. It is bad practice to write other code 
# directly into this file, because doing so causes confusion if this biogem 
# was ever to get merged into the main bioruby tree.
